#this is the home for functions that interact directly with
#my google drive

#drive_setup connects to and authenticates with my drive

#drive_fill uploads the results from my webscrapers into
#their properly organized folders

#dl_items takes a file name as argument, searches the drive
#for that file, then does a check to see if it received the
#name of a folder or a file. if it was given a folder, it will
#download the entire contents of that folder as well as any
#subfolders and their contents as well. I need to rework
#the code to make it a little cleaner, but I felt it was more
#important to first get something that works, then make it
#work better

#as soon as I figure out a reasonable way to implement account
#switching, I will be a very happy coder

#temporary fix for the above, when invoking drive_setup you
#should pass in both the SCOPES you want it to be able to
#use as well as the directory where you want it to look for
#token.json
